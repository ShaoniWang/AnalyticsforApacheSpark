# About Analytics for Apache Spark

Apache Spark is an open source cluster computing framework optimized for
extremely fast and large scale data processing.

You can connect to your existing data sources or take advantage of the
on-demand big data optimization of Object Storage. Spark plans are based
on the maximum number of executors available to process your analytic
jobs. Executors exist only as long as they're needed for processing, so
you're charged only for processing done.

The Analytics for Apache Spark service stands out for its:

  - Speed  
    Apache Spark delivers 100x the performance of Apache Hadoop for
    certain workloads because of its advanced in-memory computing
    engine.
  - Ease of use  
    Apache Spark's Streaming and SQL programming models backed by MLlib
    and GraphX make it incredibly easy for developers and data
    scientists to build apps that exploit machine learning and graph
    analytics. Because the service is 100% compatible with Apache Spark,
    developers can build their apps and run them against the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}
    managed service to benefit from operational, maintenance, and
    hardware excellence.
  - Convenient data storage  
    Object Storage enables a convenient way to upload your data from a
    file for immediate use by your Spark service.
